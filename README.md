# My Projects

---

This is my repository of my personal projects for progressing my own learning & knowledge


### Python

> A simple hello world example is supplied along with

> a simple implementation of teh boardgame Battleships.

> A mainframe of using MongoDB with Python called 'Tesgo'

> this file works with a mongoDB database with a series of

> IF statements for a simple CLI documenting a version

> of a supermarket control interface



### SQL

> This folder contains a series of completed query searches made

> for exercise and learning purposes to help my understanding

> of the relationships between tables and data that a business

> would assign to a lower level operative.



### RStudio

> A build up of functions that progressively train the understanding

> of the workings in R, from print functions to calculating prime

> numbers using sieve's algorithm and further on to developing a

> behaviour tree and using k to the nearest neighbour algorithm

> to predict salaries and accuracy in datasets


### Data Science
> This is a personal project from using the Rstudio application
> I have used the free housing test data supplied my Kaggle for
> predicting house pricing and used a concept called XGBoost to
> predict house prices. This method is fairly new but does return
> highly accurate results.
